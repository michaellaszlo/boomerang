# Boomerang

Boomerang is a template system that uses Go. The template syntax is based
on that of PHP. You can make a dynamic web page by interleaving static
HTML with sections of Go code that generate HTML. The resulting template
must be compiled by Boomerang's buildapp tool to make an executable that
runs on a web server such as Apache.


## Example
